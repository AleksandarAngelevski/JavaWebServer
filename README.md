  Decided to code a web server for a chat app using pure java. We'll see how it goes...

  Don't know if i'll try to implement web sockets for the chat app. Most likely the server is going to host my portfolio site.
  Current functionalities: request parsing, URI (route) parsing, ability to server static html files along with stylesheets.
